# How To Use The Notebook

Make sure to update the file_path variable in the notebook to point to the NetCDF or HDF5 file you want to process. For example:

```
file_path = 'P5023_magnetic_gradient_reduced.nc'
```

Then you should be able to run the rest of the cells. I put comments and titles to explain what each section does.
